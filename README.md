# Weave for Mac
### This was an experiment I did to make a web browser using ChatGPT and is also my playground for messing around with Swift(UI). DO NOT USE THIS!

But, while we're here...

**Features:**

Back/forward page navigation

Refreshing pages

Unified search and URL bar

Favicon and page title support

An extremely basic attempt at adblocking

Completely WebKit and SwiftUI based, extremely lightweight and efficient

Uses system font on all webpages

**Requirements:**

An Intel or Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Ventura or newer (Monterey is also confirmed to work if you change the build target, it just doesn't display correctly.)

Built with Xcode 15, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (mostly) with ChatGPT.
