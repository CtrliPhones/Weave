# Weave for Mac
### This was an experiment I did to make a web browser using ChatGPT and is also my playground for messing around with Swift(UI). DO NOT USE THIS!

*But, while we're here...*

## Features:

Back/forward page navigation

Refreshing pages

Unified search and URL bar

A clean design

macOS tab and multi-window support

Favicon and page title support

An extremely basic attempt at adblocking

Completely WebKit and SwiftUI based, extremely lightweight and efficient

Uses system font on all webpages

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Monterey or later

Built with Xcode 15, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (mostly) with ChatGPT.

## What's next?

Updates to the iPad app

Potentially a home button

File download support

Maybe some commands to enter into the address bar, for easter eggs and functional reasons...
