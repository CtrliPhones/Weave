# Weave for Mac
### This was an experiment I did to make a web browser using ChatGPT and is also my playground for messing around with Swift(UI). Don't seriously use this as your main browser.

*But, while we're here...*

## Features:

Basic navigation stuff

A clean design

macOS tabbing and multi-window support

Support for macOS built in toolbar customizations

Favicon and page title loading support

An extremely basic attempt at adblocking

Completely WebKit and SwiftUI based, extremely lightweight and efficient

Uses system font on all webpages

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Monterey or later

Built with Xcode 15, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (kinda) with ChatGPT.

## What's next?

Potentially a home button

A clear cache/cookies/data button (near future honestly)

File download support

Maybe some commands to enter into the address bar, for easter eggs and functional reasons...
